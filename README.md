# 🛡 Cybersecurity Internship Tasks – Elevate Labs

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Internship repository!  
This repo contains my completed tasks as part of the **Cybersecurity Internship at Elevate Labs**, focused on hands-on learning in ethical hacking, vulnerability scanning, and security analysis.


---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Local network port scanning using **Nmap**
- Email phishing detection and header spoofing analysis
- Vulnerability scanning using **OpenVAS** on vulnerable machines like Metasploitable2
- Using **CVSS scoring** and report generation
- GitHub documentation and professional reporting

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 🔍 Task 1: Local Network Port Scanning
- Tool Used: **Nmap**
- Target: My Local Network
- Techniques: TCP SYN Scan (`-sS`), Service Version Detection (`-sV`), Aggressive Scan (`-A`)
- Output: [View Scan Report](https://ranjith241.neocities.org/port)
- Deliverables: `port.xml`, `port.html`, summary report

---

### 🐟 Task 2: Phishing Email Analysis
- Tools: **Google Admin Toolbox**, manual inspection
- Work: Created a fake phishing email sample, analyzed spoofed headers, identified security red flags
- Deliverables: `phishing-sample.txt`, `header-analysis.txt`, `phishing-report.md`, screenshots

### 🔐 Task 3: Vulnerability Scan using OpenVAS
- Target: **Metasploitable2** (intentionally vulnerable VM)
- Tool Used: **OpenVAS (GVM)**
- Findings: Critical vulnerabilities like vsftpd backdoor, Samba RCE, MySQL misconfigurations
- Deliverables: `scan-report.pdf`, screenshots, `README.md` with mitigation guidance

### ✅ Task 4: Firewall Configuration using UFW (Kali Linux)
- Enabled and configured UFW to allow and block specific ports
- Allowed SSH (Port 22), blocked Telnet (Port 23)
- Practiced deleting and re-adding firewall rules
- Captured command outputs and behavior
- Summarized how firewall filters traffic and protects systems
