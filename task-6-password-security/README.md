1. **Created Multiple Passwords**  
   Designed four different passwords ranging from weak to very strong.

2. **Tested Password Strength**  
   Used online password checkers to evaluate:
   - Strength score (%)
   - Estimated time to crack
   - Security feedback

3. **Documented Results**  
   Recorded results in a comparison table.

4. **Researched Common Password Attacks**  
   Reviewed brute force, dictionary, and phishing techniques.

5. **Listed Best Practices**  
   Outlined guidelines for creating strong passwords.

## 📊 Password Strength Results

| Password                         | Score (%) | Time to Crack         | Feedback                                  |
|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `apple123`                       | 37%       | Less than a second    | Too short, contains dictionary word        |
| `Apple@123`                      | 81%       | Few minutes           | Medium complexity, could be longer         |
| `P@ssw0rd!2025`                   | 100%       | Hours                 | Strong but contains common word pattern    |
| `Gr33n$PineAppl3!2025#Secure`     | 100%      | Centuries             | Very strong, good mix of characters        |

## ⚠️ Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** – Trying all possible character combinations until the password is found.
- **Dictionary Attack** – Using a list of common words or leaked passwords.
- **Phishing** – Tricking the user into revealing their password.

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use **12–16+ characters**
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols**
- Avoid personal information
- Use **passphrases** (e.g., `CorrectHorseBatteryStaple!`)
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

---

## 📌 Outcome
Strong passwords significantly increase the difficulty of a successful attack. This task reinforced the importance of complexity and unpredictability in password creation.
